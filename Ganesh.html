        <p>There are many different stories about the birth of Ganesh. Most state that Ganesh was created by the goddess Parvati. Whilst taking a bath, Parvati took some turmeric paste and created a human form from it and brought it to life. Parvati then instructed her new son to guard the gates whilst she bathed.</p>
