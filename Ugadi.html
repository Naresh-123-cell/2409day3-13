        <P>Ugadi is celebrated on the first day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (Marchâ€“April) following the South Indian Amavasyant calendar, in which months end on the day of the new moon. The new year marks the beginning of the calendar cycle as well as the start of spring and the planting season. The correspondence of the holiday with the waxing moon in the first month of the Hindu year symbolizes growth.
