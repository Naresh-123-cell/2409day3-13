        <p>Play games:can play games like kite flying.A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces.
            <br>Wind blowing against the kite's sail is blocked by the sail and is forced to move around the kite. If the kite is positioned at the proper angle to the wind, more air is deflected down from the sail than is forced up and over the kite, thus creating lift. This lifts the kite upward, overcoming the force of gravity.
